idea1:
 now greedy performs consistently to 1024. 
before moving on to ML.
let's try to make the most of it.
How about a slow and fast thinking mode. 
When there's a lot of empty slots on the board, greedy is fine (and below 1024), when after 1024 and few slots, try use Tree search, let's test it.
It's like a combined agent for greedy and tree search, any ideas ? does it make sense? 

idea2:
for greedy, what make it to crash after 1024? advanced greedy
maybe add a some award if it can align itself with a snake like pattern (i know it from playing it from human experience, you also know the trick right?)
let's design the ultimate greedy agent with preferred rules and strategies. 

ML:
visualize neural-net
