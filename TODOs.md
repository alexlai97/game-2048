# 2048 AI Learning Project TODOs

## Phase 2: AI Implementations ✅ (Complete - Tree Search)
- [x] Create AI agent base class and framework
- [x] Random Agent (baseline)
- [x] Greedy Search with heuristics (6x better than random baseline!)
- [x] AI runner with batch testing and statistics
- [x] Add AI visualization to GUI
- [x] Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning (implemented with depth=3, optimized heuristics)
- [x] Expectimax algorithm (probabilistic tree search, better for stochastic games)
- [x] Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (UCB1 selection, configurable simulations)
- [x] GUI integration with all 5 agents (optimized for real-time visualization)

## Phase 3: Deep Learning Implementations 🎯 (Next Phase)
- [ ] Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- [ ] Advanced Deep RL (Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic)
- [ ] Neural network architecture exploration
- [ ] Training pipeline and hyperparameter tuning

## Phase 4: Analysis & Comparison (Future)
- [ ] Comprehensive performance comparison framework
- [ ] Advanced visualization of AI strategies
- [ ] Training curves and learning statistics
- [ ] Strategy effectiveness analysis and optimization
- [ ] Tournament-style agent comparison
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite

## Completed ✅
- [x] Project planning and research
- [x] Create project structure and documentation
- [x] Implement core 2048 game logic
- [x] Create terminal-based user interface
- [x] Add game controls and display
- [x] Test game functionality
- [x] Create modern PySide6 GUI (replaced tkinter)
- [x] Set up proper virtual environment with PySide6
- [x] Add Python code quality infrastructure with 2025 best practices
  - [x] Configure Ruff linting and formatting (replaces Flake8, Black, isort)
  - [x] Add Mypy static type checking with strict configuration
  - [x] Set up pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
  - [x] Add Black code formatter with 88-character line length
  - [x] Create development dependencies in requirements-dev.txt

## Performance Summary (Latest Results)

### Agent Performance Rankings
1. **GreedyAgent**: ~9,000 avg score, 1024 max tile, <1ms per move ⭐ **Best Overall**
2. **ExpectimaxAgent**: ~7,000 avg score, 512-1024 max tile, ~25s per move
3. **MCTSAgent**: ~4,500 avg score, 512 max tile, ~30s per move
4. **MinimaxAgent**: ~5,000 avg score, 512 max tile, ~20s per move
5. **RandomAgent**: ~1,500 avg score, 128-256 max tile, <1ms per move (baseline)

### Key Insights
- **Greedy heuristics outperform tree search** for this domain (speed + performance)
- **Expectimax > Minimax** for stochastic games like 2048
- **MCTS** shows promise but needs more simulations for better performance
- **Tree search agents** are educational but computationally expensive

### Next Steps
- Implement deep reinforcement learning (DQN, A3C, PPO)
- Compare neural networks vs heuristic approaches
- Optimize tree search algorithms for better performance
