# 2048 AI Learning Project TODOs

## Phase 2: AI Implementations ✨ (Current Phase)
- [x] Create AI agent base class and framework
- [x] Random Agent (baseline)
- [x] Greedy Search with heuristics (5x better than random baseline!)
- [x] AI runner with batch testing and statistics
- [ ] Add AI visualization to GUI
- [ ] Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning
- [ ] Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- [ ] Expectimax algorithm
- [ ] Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- [ ] Advanced Deep RL (Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic)

## Phase 3: Analysis & Comparison (Future)
- [ ] Performance comparison framework
- [ ] Visualization of AI strategies
- [ ] Training curves and statistics
- [ ] Strategy effectiveness analysis

## Completed ✅
- [x] Project planning and research
- [x] Create project structure and documentation
- [x] Implement core 2048 game logic
- [x] Create terminal-based user interface
- [x] Add game controls and display
- [x] Test game functionality
- [x] Create modern PySide6 GUI (replaced tkinter)
- [x] Set up proper virtual environment with PySide6

## Notes
- Focus on game implementation first before AI
- Use Python for main implementation
- Keep code modular for easy AI integration later
